This repository contains the code used in the examples of the paper "Log-density gradient covariance and automatic metric tensors for Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods" by Tore Selland Kleppe

Also included is a snapshot of the pdmphmc package (see [https://github.com/torekleppe/pdmphmc] for continued development) used to generate the output of the paper.
 
Stan computations were carried out using package rstan version 2.26.23 and StanHeaders version 2.26.28.
